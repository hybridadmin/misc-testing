# AWS Backups - Terraform/Terragrunt

Multi-account, multi-region AWS backup infrastructure deployed via Terraform modules and Terragrunt. Ported from a CDK/CloudFormation project.

## Overview

This project manages disaster recovery across an AWS Organization. It creates backup vaults, backup plans, cross-account copy jobs, AMI replication, ECR image mirroring, and Route 53 zone backups. Resources are spread across three deployment targets:

| Component | Account | Region(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **backup-vault** | Backup/DR account | `us-west-2` | Central backup vault, S3 bucket for Route 53 exports, KMS key, cross-account IAM role |
| **member_backups** | Each member account (not backup account) | `eu-west-1`, `af-south-1` | Per-account backup vault, backup plan with cross-region copy, EventBridge forwarding rules |
| **backup_plans_lambdas** | DevOps account (not backup account) | `eu-west-1`, `af-south-1` | Lambda functions, SQS queues, CodeBuild project, EventBridge rules, CloudWatch alarms |

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) >= 1.5 (or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/))
- [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18 (for Lambda build)
- AWS CLI configured with credentials for the target account
- S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for Terraform remote state (created automatically by Terragrunt if the bucket doesn't exist)

## Configuration

All environment-specific values are defined in `env.hcl` files. Terragrunt uses `find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl")` to resolve the nearest `env.hcl`, so region-level files override component-level files which override environment-level files.

### Key variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | Project identifier (lowercase) | `admin` |
| `environment` | Environment name (lowercase) | `prod`, `systest` |
| `aws_region` | AWS region for this deployment | `eu-west-1` |
| `devops_account_id` | Account running the Lambdas/CodeBuild | `555555555555` |
| `backup_account_id` | Central DR account with backup vault | `777777777777` |
| `backup_region` | Region for cross-region copies | `us-west-2` |
| `organization_id` | AWS Organization ID (for vault/S3 policies) | `o-pfayzcebx5` |
| `organization_arn` | AWS Organization ARN (for AMI sharing) | `arn:aws:organizations::...` |
| `devops_event_bus_arn` | EventBridge bus ARN in DevOps account | `arn:aws:events:eu-west-1:...:event-bus/default` |
| `general_notification_topic_arn` | SNS topic for general alerts | `arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:...:...` |
| `critical_notification_topic_arn` | SNS topic for critical alerts | `arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:...:...` |
| `ami_encryption_kms_key_arn` | KMS key/alias for encrypting copied AMIs | `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:...:alias/...` |
| `route53_config` | Account IDs whose Route 53 zones to back up | `["888888888888"]` |

### Remote state

The root `terragrunt.hcl` configures S3 remote state:

- **Bucket**: `{project}-{environment}-terraform-state`
- **Key**: `backups/{path_relative_to_include}/terraform.tfstate`
- **Lock table**: `{project}-{environment}-terraform-locks`
- **Region**: Inherited from the nearest `env.hcl`

## Usage

### Building Lambda functions

The Lambda build runs automatically via Terragrunt's `before_hook` when you plan or apply the `backup_plans_lambdas` component. To build manually:

```bash
cd lambdas
bash build.sh
```

This produces `lambdas/lambda.zip` containing compiled JavaScript and production `node_modules`.

### Deploying a single component

```bash
# Deploy the backup vault infrastructure
cd envs/prod/backup-vault/us-west-2
terragrunt apply

# Deploy member_backups resources for eu-west-1
cd envs/prod/member_backups/eu-west-1
terragrunt apply

# Deploy the backup_plans_lambdas stack (auto-builds lambdas)
cd envs/prod/backup_plans_lambdas/eu-west-1
terragrunt apply
```

### Deploying all components in an environment

```bash
cd envs/prod
terragrunt run-all apply
```

### Planning changes

```bash
# Single component
cd envs/prod/backup_plans_lambdas/eu-west-1
terragrunt plan

# All components
cd envs/prod
terragrunt run-all plan
```

### Deploying to a specific member account

The member_backups directory structure deploys to whichever AWS account your credentials target (must not be the backup account). To deploy to multiple member accounts in the same region, either:

1. **Switch credentials** between `terragrunt apply` runs (e.g., using `AWS_PROFILE` or `aws sts assume-role`), or
2. **Create per-account subdirectories** under the region directory:

```
envs/prod/member_backups/eu-west-1/
├── account-111111111111/
│   ├── env.hcl
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── account-222222222222/
    ├── env.hcl
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

### Destroying resources

```bash
# Single component
cd envs/prod/backup-vault/us-west-2
terragrunt destroy

# All components (respects dependency order)
cd envs/prod
terragrunt run-all destroy
```

## Modules

### `backup-vault`

Deployed once in the backup/DR account (`us-west-2`). Creates the central backup destination.

**Resources created:**
- KMS key with key rotation (for vault and S3 encryption)

### `backup_plans_lambdas`

Deployed in the DevOps account (not the backup account). Orchestrates backup operations via Lambda functions.

**Account guard:** A `terraform_data` precondition prevents this module from being applied in the backup account (`777777777777`).

**Regions:** `eu-west-1` (prod, systest), `af-south-1` (prod only).

**Resources created:**
- 5 Lambda functions (Node.js 18, TypeScript) with individual IAM roles
- SQS queue + dead-letter queue for deferred AMI copy processing
- CloudWatch alarms on DLQ messages and queue age
- EventBridge rules for backup copy events, EC2 AMI events, ECR image events, and a daily Route 53 backup schedule
- CodeBuild project for ECR image cross-account/cross-region copying (privileged mode for Docker)

**Lambda functions:**

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `backupRoute53` | Schedule (daily 00:00 UTC) | Assumes role in each configured account, dumps Route 53 hosted zones to S3 in backup account |
| `copyBackup` | EventBridge (Copy Job State Change) | When a backup copy completes in a member account's `us-west-2` vault, copies the recovery point to the backup account vault |
| `ec2ImageEventHandler` | EventBridge (EC2 CopyImage/DeregisterImage) | On AMI creation: queues a deferred copy. On deregistration: deletes backup copies |
| `ec2ImageCopy` | SQS (15-minute delay) | Copies AMI to backup region, tags it, shares with org or backup account |
| `ecrImageEventHandler` | EventBridge (ECR Image Action) | On push: starts CodeBuild to replicate image. On delete: removes from backup account/region |

## Deployment Order

Components must be deployed in the following order due to cross-account dependencies:

1. **backup-vault** -- Creates the vault, S3 bucket, and IAM role that other components reference.
2. **member_backups** (all regions) -- Creates per-account vaults, backup plans, and cross-account roles that Lambdas assume.
3. **backup_plans_lambdas** -- Deploys the Lambda functions that assume roles in member and backup accounts.

When destroying, reverse the order.

## Environments

### prod

Fully configured with all three components across two regions:

- Backup account in `us-west-2`
- Member backups in `eu-west-1` (primary), `af-south-1` (Cape Town)
- Backup plans & lambdas in `eu-west-1`, `af-south-1`

### systest

Reduced deployment for testing:

- No backup account (the `backup_account_id` is not yet defined)
- Member backups in `eu-west-1` only
- Backup plans & lambdas in `eu-west-1`

> **Note:** The systest environment mirrors the original CDK project where `backupAccount` and `backupRegion` were not defined. Before deploying systest to production, populate `backup_account_id` in the systest `env.hcl` files.

## Adding a New Member Account

1. Ensure AWS credentials target the new member account.
2. Navigate to the desired region directory under `envs/<env>/member_backups/<region>/`.
3. Run `terragrunt apply`.

If you need per-account state isolation (recommended for production), create account-specific subdirectories:

```
envs/prod/member_backups/eu-west-1/
└── <account-id>/
    ├── env.hcl          # Same as parent env.hcl
    └── terragrunt.hcl   # Same as parent terragrunt.hcl, adjust source path
```

## Adding a New Region

1. Create a new region directory under `envs/<env>/member_backups/<new-region>/`.
2. Create `env.hcl` with the `aws_region` set to the new region.
3. Create `terragrunt.hcl` with appropriate feature toggles (use `af-south-1` or `us-west-2` as a template depending on the region's role).
4. If the new region has org-level permission limitations (like Cape Town), set `is_cape_town = true`.

## Cape Town (af-south-1) Limitations

The `af-south-1` region does not support organization-level principals in:

- KMS key policies (the backup account service role statement is omitted)
- Backup vault access policies (the vault policy resource is not created)

These are controlled by the `is_cape_town` variable. The EventBridge forwarding role created in `eu-west-1` is referenced by ARN from Cape Town for event forwarding targets.

## Naming Conventions

Resources follow these naming patterns, where `project=admin` and `environment=prod`:

| Resource | Name Pattern | Example |

## Restoring from Backup

When restoring a backup, specify the regional `BackupSelectionRole`:

```
ADMIN-PROD-BACKUP-BackupSelectionRole-eu-west-1
```

The default AWS Backup service role does not have the S3 backup/restore permissions attached to the selection role.
